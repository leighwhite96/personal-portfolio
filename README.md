# Personal Portfolio - made with HTML, CSS and Basic JavaScript

An ongoing project that I will expand on and fill up with relevant information as I progress. It is currently a one page template that utilises Bootstrap features such as modals and carousels and nav bars etc. I designed it mobile first and have ensured that the page looks appropriate on smaller screens. 

Going forward I will ensure that the website repsonds well to devices larger than a standard laptop screen. 

To view my portfolio page open your console and run 

```
git clone <url> 
```

and then copy the project path and open in a browser of your choice (preferably Chrome).
